CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

Architecture

    Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
    Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
    
    Express HTML creates a simple webpage that can display information but it is not as interactive as other methods. Javascript adds a bit more interactivity and API end points. SPA makes loading times faster and can give admin abilities to frontend users. A no SQL database like MongoDB is a good solution for this because it uses JSON format and has easy integration with Javascript.
    
Functionality

    How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
    Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
    
    JSON is a way to store data and transmit data using human readable text. Javascript is the language that builds the webpage and uses JSON to transmit data. Having a reusable user interface is beneficial so that you can insert it where needed and not have to hard code the full HTML each time.

Testing

    Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
    
    Methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE are how the application communicates. these methods are sent and received through API endpoints. These endpoints need to be secured against unauthorized access, otherwise anyone could make changes to you application and cause havoc.
